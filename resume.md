Personal recommendations:
I received personal recommendations from 4 people:
Robotics for Bulgaria,
My classroom teacher, that teaches Software development

My classmate, that was in Teenovator competition with me

And from my current employer
I will post pictures from the recommendation letters, but you can find the original PDFS

For me
    Hello,
My name is Stylian Matev and I am from the town of. I'm from Kazanlak.
I study at the "Nikola Obreshkov" Vocational School in the vocational class for Applied Programmer in a dual form of training, studying C#. I am currently a final year student, in 12th grade

I have a strong interest in programming. This past summer I was able to participate in two summer internships in addition to the required hands-on classes at school. 
In these internship jobs I performed actual assigned tasks using PHP, SQL, and Laravel - a framework for PHP, also hardware maintenance of computer equipment. Last year's summer internship mainly involved mobile app development.

I am currently working at NETCELS.BG Ltd as an Application Developer, part time 3 days/week.
I maintain and work on the website https://www.programiram.com/ , which requires knowledge of Laravel.
I'm also working on the https://kompleks-sveti-dimitar.com/bg/ website, which requires mainly JavaScript and Frond-end knowledge.
I was involved in the creation and optimization of our Adaptive learning platform focused on interactive code lessons code with blocks and IT mathematics for Bulgarian student www.Programiram.com  Which is used in more than 150 Bulgarian schools and help teachers work with the students on programming challenges with blocks and Python code.

My interests include programming in different languages, robotics, photography, delving into interesting facts, and having in-depth conversations with those around me on a variety of topics. I like to solve Rubik's cube at speed, I try to do regular fitness, and I listen to contemporary music. I own a 3D printer on which I make creative accessories and parts for my robots - my own development. 

   I consider myself responsible, inquisitive, positive and motivated.

-I have independently studied Artificial Intelligence through various online courses, research papers and online videos- covering topics ranging from the basic use of existing models to setting up and utilizing multi-agent systems that incorporate RAG and custom tools. Additionally, I have learned how to fine-tune models for specific needs and even create my own models using custom datasets. 
-I have also studied advanced math specific to AI, to be able to better understand and modify AI models as needed
-As a part of robotic competition Robotics for Bulgaria (which The team that I led won on national level) I have learned how to program Arduino robots, to 3D model them and 3D print parts for them.
-I have enrolled in SOFTUNI in a 4 year study and graduated as a FULL STACK JAVA Developer
- I Have Acquired through tutorials documentation tutorials and practical work knowledge in Python for AI on a high working level.
-Beyond academics, I have acquired leadership and teamwork skills through various competitions
